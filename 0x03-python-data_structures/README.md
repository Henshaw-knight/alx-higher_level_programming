# Python Lists and Tuples

Python lists and tuples are two of the most important data structures in the language. Lists are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they are created. Tuples, on the other hand, are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are created.

## Lists

Lists are a great way to store a collection of items in a single variable. They can be used to store any type of data, including integers, strings, floats, lists, and even tuples.

To create a list, you use square brackets [].
You can access individual elements of a list using their index. The index of the first element is 0, the index of the second element is 1, and so on.

Lists can be modified in a number of ways. You can add or remove elements from a list, or you can change the value of an existing element.


## Tuples

Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, it cannot be changed.

To create a tuple, you use parentheses ().

You can access individual elements of a tuple using their index, just like you do with lists. However, you cannot change the value of an element of a tuple.
