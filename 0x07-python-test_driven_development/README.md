## Python tests

Python tests are a critical part of any Python project. They help to ensure that the code is working as expected and to prevent bugs from being introduced.

Python tests are important for a number of reasons:
- They help to prevent bugs. By writing tests for your code, you can catch bugs early on before they make it into production. This can save you a lot of time and headache down the road.
- They improve the quality of your code. Writing tests forces you to think carefully about how your code works and to make sure that it is well-designed. This can lead to better code overall.
- They make it easier to maintain your code. When your code is well-tested, it is easier to make changes to it without introducing new bugs.
- They make it easier to deploy your code. If your code is well-tested, you can be more confident that it will work correctly when it is deployed to production.
